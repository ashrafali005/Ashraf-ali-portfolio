            <h3>Cybersecurity Enthusiast</h3>
            <p>
                Hey there! I'm Ashraf Ali I a passionate Cybersecurity enthusiast and a 3rd-year student at K.S.R Institute of Engineering and Technology (KSRIET). My journey into cybersecurity began with a curiosity to understand how digital systems work and how to protect them from evolving threats.
               I’m skilled in identifying vulnerabilities, understanding complex attack vectors, and implementing secure solutions. My interests lie in ethical hacking, threat analysis, penetration testing, and creating awareness about safe online practices.
              I’m currently working on a Cybersecurity Awareness Website that includes interactive tools like a password strength checker, quizzes, dynamic news updates, and detailed insights on various cyber attacks. This project reflects my goal to spread cybersecurity knowledge in a simple yet engaging way.
